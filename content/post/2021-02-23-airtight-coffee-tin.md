For reasons I am not quite sure the wife has decided that we needed to start drinking [fancy coffee](http://www.oaklandcoffee.com) and the store brand stuff was no good. The problem was that the store brand stuff came in it's own tin which was large-mouthed and it was really easy to dig the coffee out ih the morning. The bags that this coffee comes in is hard to manage with the scoop without getting more coffee on the counter than in the french press. So I tasked her with getting a better tin and this is what she came up with.
