    <img src="/assets/dellp2317h.jpg"><p>In addtion to my <a href="https://stuffwriter.com/asus-23-inch-monitor/">Asus monitor</a> I also use this Dell monitor too as a secondary monitor. Currently I use it mostly as a big baby monitor so I can keep an eye on the little one while she&rsquo;s in bed. These <a href="https://amzn.to/2PZ6oIs">sell new</a> for about $250.00 but I paid much, much less. I bought these as a pair used, but one got broken during shipping so I ended up keeping the good monitor an only paying the $20.00 shipping fee for the one that made it. I think a $20 Dell monitor is a pretty good price to pay. You can find these used for about $100</p>
