  <a href= "https://amzn.to/34c4A6U">  <img src="/assets/precisionscrewdriver.jpg"></a><p>I have better precision screwdrivers now so I think that this will get tossed as I no longer have a use for it. But for six bucks if you need a small set of screwdrivers you could do worse. I have used these for a good ten years and they have never failed me. My big problem is they get lost or misplaced over time, but you might have better luck.</p>
