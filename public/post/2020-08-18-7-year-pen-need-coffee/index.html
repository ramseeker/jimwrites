    <img src="/assets/7yearpen.jpg"><p>I haven&rsquo;t had this pen for 7 years yet so I will have to get back to you when it comes to whether it lasts the 7 years but I am surprised that they sell for over $12.00. For a pen! This was a gift so I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the cost but I had <strong>better</strong> get at least 7 years out of it. That&rsquo;s almost 2 dollars a year for a pen.</p>
