      Hey there, I am Jim and I am writing about <b> every item I own.</b> I have written about <a href="http://jimwrites.com"><b>44 items so far</a> </b>. This is going to take a while<BR><BR>

      
        <h1>One Small Paperclip</h1><time>August 13, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/33VS4sj"> <b><a href= "https://amzn.to/33VS4sj" ><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Check Price </b></a></p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/33VS4sj">  <img src="/assets/paperclip.jpg"></a><p>I think I have had the same box of <a href="https://amzn.to/33VS4sj">1000 paperclips</a> for over 20 years now and I <strong>still</strong> have the same box. What can I write about a paperclip? It&rsquo;s..a paperclip. They are good for other uses than the intended though and I have used them for everything from sim card ejectors for phones to just keeping something secure and sometimes a paperclip is the very first thing I try.</p>
