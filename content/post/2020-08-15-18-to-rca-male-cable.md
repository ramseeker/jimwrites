title: 1/8 3.5mm to dual RCA Adapter
---

Another cable in my neverending cable box, and this time it's a 1/8 to 2 Male RCA cable that is used to hookup things that have a headphone jack like your phone or computer to your home stereo or other device that has rca inputs. Currently I am using one to connect a DAC to a headphone amplifier. These are only about $10.00.
