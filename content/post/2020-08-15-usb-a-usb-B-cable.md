title: USB A to USB Cable

I know for a fact that I have more than one of these in a drawer because **you never know** when you need one of these to hook up some peripheral to your computer. These cables are commonly used to connect a printer via USB but some peripherals use this cable too like my [Topping D10 DAC](http:stuffwriter.com/topping-d10-dac/). Price is about $7.00 for these.
