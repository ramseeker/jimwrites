title: Topping D10 USB DAC
---

I've gone through a few DACs and if was being completly honest they all sound just about the same. I like this particular one though as it has both optical and COAX out in addtion to RCA. This allows me to use 2 amplifiers with just one DAC. This DAC sells for about $80.00 new.
