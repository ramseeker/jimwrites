I'm writing this from my little man cave in the corner of our basement and I mostly listen to headphones because: sleeping toddlers. But sometimes I fire up my old home theater receiver and play some music for speakers.

I use this as a **very near** near field speaker so I can keep the volume down. These are pretty cheap if you can find one used, but expect to pay about $200 for something that's newer yet similar in specifications.
