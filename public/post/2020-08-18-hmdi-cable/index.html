        <h1>Assorted HDMI Cables</h1><time>August 18, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/34aowah"> <b><a href= "https://amzn.to/34aowah" ><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Check Price </b></a></p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/34aowah">  <img src="/assets/hdmicable.jpg"></a><p>I have multiples of this item from various manufacturers and makes and I can tell you that I don&rsquo;t notice one bit of performance difference between any of them so my advice is to just get a well made cable like the <a href="https://amzn.to/34aowah">AmazonBasics HDMI Cable</a> and be done.</p>
