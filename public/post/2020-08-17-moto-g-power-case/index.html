        <h1>Motorola Moto G Power Case</h1><time>August 17, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/3kYraWW"> <b><a href= "https://amzn.to/3kYraWW" ><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Check Price </b></a></p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3kYraWW">  <img src="/assets/motocase.jpg"></a><p>I had to buy a new phone recently, and I decided on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3hioWPy">Motorola Moto G Power</a> as it was relatively cheap and I just needed a phone for a month or two until the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kQEI6C">phone I wanted</a> was released later this summer. So I just picked a cheap case for my phone as I wasn&rsquo;t planning on keeping it long</p>
