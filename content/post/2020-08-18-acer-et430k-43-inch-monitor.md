title: Acer ET430K 43 inch monitor
---

I writing this while looking at a ridiculously large 43 inch monitor. The monitor I have is the Acer ET430K but it looks like it's been discontinued which is too bad because I only paid $350.00 for a refurbished model and I have had it for close to 2 years now and have had **zero problems** with it - it's been great. I think I would be able to live without a monitor this size, but it's fun. Also, I can make the font size huge for my aging eyes.
