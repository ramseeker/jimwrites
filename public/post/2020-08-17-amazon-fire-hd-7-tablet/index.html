        <h1>Amazon Kindle Fire 7</h1><time>August 17, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/3iR3otT"> <b><a href= "https://amzn.to/3iR3otT" ><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Check Price </b></a></p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3iR3otT">  <img src="/assets/fire7hd.jpg"></a><p>I bought this last holiday season for <strong>under $30.00</strong>, and when you think about it that&rsquo;s an insane price for a tablet - any tablet - regardless of quality or features.  This ended up being my little one&rsquo;s tablet as I threw a [kid proof case])https://amzn.to/2YbYYpE) on it and then I really don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. It&rsquo;s not the greatest tablet but for the price one can&rsquo;t complain. I&rsquo;ve used it as a music player, ereader, TV for entertaining the kiddo and for light web browsing. The fact that this costs $30 is excellent value.</p>
