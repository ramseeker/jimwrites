I'm a fan of [Logitech Mice](https://amzn.to/30TzuyX). They work well for me and it's all I need. I have tried some other mice like the [Amazon Basics Mouse](https://amzn.to/30UW6yY) and they are **okay** but not great.

I have tried all kinds of mice: [Apple Mice](https://amzn.to/2CuM52o), [Gaming Mice](https://amzn.to/31T7gE1) and I have probably spent hundreds of dollars on different input devices but the logitech mice work the best for me it seems and they are cheap at about $20.00 - or less if you can find one on sale.bundl
