title: Asus VS239-H 23 inch IPS Monitor

I researched and researched for a cheap IPS monitor and this one fit the bill. It's big enough, bright enough and sharp enough. I'm not a gamer so the other stuff doesn't really matter like refresh rate. For general computer use you could do worse. Priced at about $120.00
