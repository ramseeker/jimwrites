title: Bic Round Stic Pen Blue Medium
---

If I had to pick one pen it would be these. Bic Round Stic Blue Medium Pens. They are **cheap** at about five bucks a box and even though I am apt to lose pens I find a box of these last me for a pretty long time. I know there are those that are pen collectors but I just don't get it as I rarely do any actual writing any more and these do the trick just fine for pennies each.
