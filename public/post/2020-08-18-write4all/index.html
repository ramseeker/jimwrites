        <h1>Stabilo Write 4 All</h1><time>August 18, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/3aCoKbK"> <b><a href= "https://amzn.to/3aCoKbK" ><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Check Price </b></a></p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3aCoKbK">  <img src="/assets/write4all.jpg"></a><p>I think I bought this for when I was burning CD&rsquo;s and I needed a marker for writing the song or album info. Of course, those days are long gone with <a href="http://spotify.com">spotify</a> and the like so this isn&rsquo;t really needed and I doubt it will get replaced. They cost about $1.50 each.</p>
