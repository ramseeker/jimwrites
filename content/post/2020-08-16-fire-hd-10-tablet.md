I was given a hundred dollar Amazon gift card a few years back so I picked up this tablet. It's ..fine. It's no iPad, but [it was on sale](https://amzn.to/3ats20R) for $100 when I bought it so it costs a third of the price. It's not the fastest and you're limited to the Amazon ecosystem unless you hack it but for the price and what you do using tablet, it's great for my uses a kindle reader, spotify remote or music player - and for a music player it sounds really great for the price.
