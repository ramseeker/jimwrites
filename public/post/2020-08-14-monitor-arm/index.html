  <a href= "https://amzn.to/2CrWZ8T">  <img src="/assets/monitorarm.jpg"></a><p>I think one of the best things you can do for yourself is to make sure your computer station or desk is as ergonomic as possible and one way to do this is to replace the stand you have with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2CrWZ8T">monitor arm you can adjust</a>.</p>
<p>I have one that allows me to have a 2nd monitor off to my right while I use my main monitor for the big work. These arms can get expensive, but I only paid about $30 for mine and I think that if I had to I would buy it again.</p>
