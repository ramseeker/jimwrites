  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3468Ogq">  <img src="/assets/statuscb1.jpg"></a><p>I needed a pair of closed-back over ear headphones and these were cheap enough and got good reviews so here they are. They are <strong>fine</strong>. These are the headphones I use when I don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed or disturb others with my music or movies. My only complaint with these is that they feel more like on-ears on my big head and they are not the most comfortable headphone I have ever bought. These Headphones are Priced at about $55.00 usually.</p>
