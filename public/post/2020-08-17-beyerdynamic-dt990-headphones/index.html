  <a href= "https://amzn.to/2Y9RV0I">  <img src="/assets/dt990.jpg"></a><p>These headphones were purchased with an <a href="https://amzn.to/2FzQoKT">Amazon Gift Card</a> I was given at Christmas this past year and so I chose to spend it on these headphones. It&rsquo;s been said that these are a very bright sounding headphone and I have to agree - But, because I am older and can&rsquo;t hear the high frequencies anwyway these don&rsquo;t bother me. I think I paid about $120.00 for them which I think is a great price for these.</p>
