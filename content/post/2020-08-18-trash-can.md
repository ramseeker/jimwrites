title: Office Trash Can
---

I think every home office has one of these and I am no exception. You **need** some place to toss your junk and this would do the trick. I'm surprised at how much these cost as $15.00 plus seems a lot for what it is but I'm not really up on prices for trash cans so maybe that's how much they cost.
