  <a href= "https://amzn.to/2CIp7VC">  <img src="/assets/roundstic.jpg"></a><p>If I had to pick one pen it would be these. Bic Round Stic Blue Medium Pens. They are <strong>cheap</strong> at about five bucks a box and even though I am apt to lose pens I find a box of these last me for a pretty long time. I know there are those that are pen collectors but I just don&rsquo;t get it as I rarely do any actual writing any more and these do the trick just fine for pennies each.</p>
