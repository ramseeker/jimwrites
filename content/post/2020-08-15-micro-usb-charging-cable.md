title: USB A male to USB micro b cable

I have an entire drawer full of these in certain lengths and manufacturers and yet I can't get rid of them yet as in this day and age not all my devices have gone to USB-C so I can't pitch these yet. Off the top of my head, I know my [Amazon Fire Tablets](https://amzn.to/3107oCr) still use this cable for charging. It's a good thing this cable is cheap at about $7.00
