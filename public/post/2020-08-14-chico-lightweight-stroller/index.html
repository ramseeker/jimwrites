        <h1>Chicco Mini Bravo Plus Lightweight Stroller</h1><time>August 14, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/2PXd4q8"> <b><a href= "https://amzn.to/2PXd4q8" ><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Check Price </b></a></p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/2PXd4q8">  <img src="/assets/stroller.jpg"></a><p>I use this stroller <strong>daily</strong> so it&rsquo;s earned it&rsquo;s worth (about $180.00) as it keeps the little one entertained for the hour we are out for a walk and folks you can&rsquo;t put money on an entertained toddler.</p>
<p>The buckles are a little fiddly until you get used them and this thing rolls much better with a squirt of <a href="https://amzn.to/3gZSguj">wd-40</a> on the wheels. It&rsquo;s been over a year since we&rsquo;ve had this stroller and so far so good. It folds up easily and is not that heavy. If I had one complaint is that the wheels feel like they could be sturdier but they haven&rsquo;t broken on me so perhaps this is not really a complaint.</p>
