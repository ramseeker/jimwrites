      Hey there, I am Jim and I am writing about <b> every item I own.</b> I have written about <a href="http://jimwrites.com"><b>44 items so far</a> </b>. This is going to take a while<BR><BR>

      
        <h1>MOSISO Universal Headphone Hanger</h1><time>August 13, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/3apmrZk"> <b><a href= "https://amzn.to/3apmrZk" ><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Check Price </b></a></p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3apmrZk">  <img src="/assets/headphone_hanger.jpg"></a><p>I have a few of these headphone hangers and I guess you could say I like them as I have <strong>more than one of them</strong>. They&rsquo;re simple and clamp to almost any desk I have tried with them and then you can plunk the headphones on the hangers and then swing them under the desk out of the way.</p>
<p>I think this is a great thing because I have found the less cables you have on your desktop the less chance of spilling your coffee all over your electronics. That&rsquo;s worth the $10.0 to me. I would buy this again.</p>
