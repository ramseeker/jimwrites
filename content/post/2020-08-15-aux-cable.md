title: 1/8 to 1/8 Aux Cable
---

The last cable I am writing about for today (don't worry, there's more) is a 1/8 to 1/8 aux cable. This is another cable to have in your junk drawer for just in case times. I know bluetooth is king these days but for those of us without bluetooth but with an AUX input, this cable allows us to connect our phones to the car stereo and makes the drive more bearable. This could be best 7 bucks I have ever spent!
