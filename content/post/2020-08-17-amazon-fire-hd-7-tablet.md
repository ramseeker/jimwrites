I bought this last holiday season for **under $30.00**, and when you think about it that's an insane price for a tablet - any tablet - regardless of quality or features.  This ended up being my little one's tablet as I threw a [kid proof case])https://amzn.to/2YbYYpE) on it and then I really don't have to worry about it. It's not the greatest tablet but for the price one can't complain. I've used it as a music player, ereader, TV for entertaining the kiddo and for light web browsing. The fact that this costs $30 is excellent value.
