        <h1>MOSISO Universal Headphone Hanger</h1><time>August 13, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/3apmrZk"> <b>Check price on Amazon</b></a></p>
    <img src="/assets/headphone_hanger.jpg"><p>I have a few of these headphone hangers and I guess you could say I like them as I have <strong>more than one of them</strong>. They&rsquo;re simple and clamp to almost any desk I have tried with them and then you can plunk the headphones on the hangers and then swing them under the desk out of the way.</p>
<p>I think this is a great thing because I have found the less cables you have on your desktop the less chance of spilling your coffee all over your electronics. That&rsquo;s worth the $10.0 to me. I would buy this again.</p>
<hr> <small> Interested in learning more about this item? I ask that you click <a href="https://amzn.to/3apmrZk"> this link</a> to check the price and other specifications that are available on Amazon. I get a small commission if you buy anything when you use this link
