title: MOSISO Universal Headphone Hanger
---
I have a few of these headphone hangers and I guess you could say I like them as I have **more than one of them**. They're simple and clamp to almost any desk I have tried with them and then you can plunk the headphones on the hangers and then swing them under the desk out of the way.

I think this is a great thing because I have found the less cables you have on your desktop the less chance of spilling your coffee all over your electronics. That's worth the $10.0 to me. I would buy this again.
