title: USA Baseball Cap
---

I've been in the habit lately of grabbing a ball cap as I go out the door. This is something I never did when younger, but the hat now keeps my bald spot from burnin and allows me some protection of my eyes from the sun thanks to the brim. It's not for fashion but for function so I really don't care about logos and the like but my current daily driver is like the one you see here.
