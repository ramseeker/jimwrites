Sometimes you can cheap out and just buy whatever from the dollar store but I find that it's worth the while to spend the money on good tools as they save so much time and frustration than some crappy thing. An example is I bought a cheap tape measure and it **broke on the very first use**! I had to throw it out and just cough up the money for the brand name one. With tools, you get what you pay for.
