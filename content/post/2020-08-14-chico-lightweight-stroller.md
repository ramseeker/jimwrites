title: Chicco Mini Bravo Plus Lightweight Stroller

I use this stroller **daily** so it's earned it's worth (about $180.00) as it keeps the little one entertained for the hour we are out for a walk and folks you can't put money on an entertained toddler.

The buckles are a little fiddly until you get used them and this thing rolls much better with a squirt of [wd-40](https://amzn.to/3gZSguj) on the wheels. It's been over a year since we've had this stroller and so far so good. It folds up easily and is not that heavy. If I had one complaint is that the wheels feel like they could be sturdier but they haven't broken on me so perhaps this is not really a complaint.
