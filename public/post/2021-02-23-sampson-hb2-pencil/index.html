  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3bwRKlN">  <img src="/assets/pencils.jpg"></a><p>Like a lot of stuff in my drawers at home I have no idea where I got this pencil, but here you go. I don&rsquo;t have much use for a pencil in my everyday but once in a while it&rsquo;s nice to have a few around the house. I find I mostly use it when I need to mark where I will cut some wood or make a hole in the wall. Of course, this could be used for writing and drawing too.</p>
