This was one of those things that I had bought, but never got around to using until now when I added a 2nd computer to my system (My wife bought a new [Mac Mini](https://amzn.to/3g2c7b0)) and I didn't have a dedicated monitor for it. So, I hooked my daily driver monitor up to this and my laptop and now I can switch beetween the Mac Mini and the Google PixelBook I use with ease. It was only about $7.00 too.
