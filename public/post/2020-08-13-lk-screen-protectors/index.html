      Hey there, I am Jim and I am writing about <b> every item I own.</b> I have written about <a href="http://jimwrites.com"><b>44 items so far</a> </b>. This is going to take a while<BR><BR>

      
        <h1>LK Phone Screen Protectors</h1><time>August 13, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/2PQgQSf"> <b><a href= "https://amzn.to/2PQgQSf" ><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Check Price </b></a></p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/2PQgQSf">  <img src="/assets/screenprotector.jpg"></a><p>I found this brand of screen protectors for my <a href="https://amzn.to/3fX4ySE">Google Pixel 3A</a> and I like them. You get three of them, so you have a couple of chances to get it right and straight which is a problem when you try to install these things.</p>
<p>They are glass and don&rsquo;t seem to harm the display or what you see and seem to be optically clear. I also like that these offer a nicer feel to the glass than whatever the stock glass is on phones as it feels smoother to me and makes it easier to scroll with your thumb. Then there&rsquo;s the fact that these might just save your expensive phone screen and it&rsquo;s hard not to suggest these.</p>
