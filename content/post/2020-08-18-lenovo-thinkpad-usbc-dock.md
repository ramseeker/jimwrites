I bought this so I could hook my external monitors and peripherals to my [Google Pixelbook](https://amzn.to/349r3l5) and save me from plugging/unplugging a sea of cables as this allows me to use **just one** cable to connect to all my devices. This same cable also acts as a charger too so there's even less worry. I paid nowhere the $150 price so I suggest you look for a used one if you can.
