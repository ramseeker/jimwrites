        <h1>LK Phone Screen Protectors</h1><time>August 13, 2020</time></header> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/2PQgQSf"> <b>Check price on Amazon</b></a></p>
    <img src="/assets/screenprotector.jpg"><p>I found this brand of screen protectors for my <a href="https://amzn.to/3fX4ySE">Google Pixel 3A</a> and I like them. You get three of them, so you have a couple of chances to get it right and straight which is a problem when you try to install these things.</p>
<p>They are glass and don&rsquo;t seem to harm the display or what you see and seem to be optically clear. I also like that these offer a nicer feel to the glass than whatever the stock glass is on phones as it feels smoother to me and makes it easier to scroll with your thumb. Then there&rsquo;s the fact that these might just save your expensive phone screen and it&rsquo;s hard not to suggest these.</p>
<hr> <small> Interested in learning more about this item? I ask that you click <a href="https://amzn.to/2PQgQSf"> this link</a> to check the price and other specifications that are available on Amazon. I get a small commission if you buy anything when you use this link
