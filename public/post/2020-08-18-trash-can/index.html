    <img src="/assets/trashcan.jpg"><p>I think every home office has one of these and I am no exception. You <strong>need</strong> some place to toss your junk and this would do the trick. I&rsquo;m surprised at how much these cost as $15.00 plus seems a lot for what it is but I&rsquo;m not really up on prices for trash cans so maybe that&rsquo;s how much they cost.</p>
