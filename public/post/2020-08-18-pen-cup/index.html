  <a href= "https://amzn.to/2E3FUD5">  <img src="/assets/pencup.jpg"></a><p>It&rsquo;s a cup that hold pens. There&rsquo;s not much more to say about this. The one I have is a little fancier than this one actually but it does the same thing - holds pens. I have found that these can be a PITA because you end up tossing memory cards and thumb drives and other small things in there and then you have to remove all the pens to fish them out.</p>
