  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3iR7dzb">  <img src="/assets/aceret430k.jpg"></a><p>I writing this while looking at a ridiculously large 43 inch monitor. The monitor I have is the Acer ET430K but it looks like it&rsquo;s been discontinued which is too bad because I only paid $350.00 for a refurbished model and I have had it for close to 2 years now and have had <strong>zero problems</strong> with it - it&rsquo;s been great. I think I would be able to live without a monitor this size, but it&rsquo;s fun. Also, I can make the font size huge for my aging eyes.</p>
