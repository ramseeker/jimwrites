title: Pen Cup
---

It's a cup that hold pens. There's not much more to say about this. The one I have is a little fancier than this one actually but it does the same thing - holds pens. I have found that these can be a PITA because you end up tossing memory cards and thumb drives and other small things in there and then you have to remove all the pens to fish them out.
