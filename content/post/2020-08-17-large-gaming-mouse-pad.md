title: Large Gaming Mat for Keyboard and Mouse
---

I bought two of these for about $10.00 each but I think I could have saved ten bucks and just bought one because I have retired one of them due to lack of use. Anyway it's a big honking mouse pad that covers a big part of your desk. I bought them so that I would not have to set my pricey headphones down on my hard desk and at least there would be a little padding.
