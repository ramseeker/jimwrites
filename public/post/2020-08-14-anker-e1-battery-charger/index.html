  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3455TVh">  <img src="/assets/smallankercharger.jpg"></a><p>This charger has a story. I bought this <strong>three days</strong> before my daughter was born and  I knew that I did not want to worry about having enough power or finding a wall plug at the hospital so instead of keeping my phone charged I kept this charger topped up instead and used it to charge my phone. This was probably the best purchase I made in 2019. It&rsquo;s almost 2 years later and it&rsquo;s still going strong.</p>
