title: Monolith Liquid Spark Headphone Amplifier
---

The Monolith Liquid Spark Headphone Amplifier is really all the headphone amplifier you really need as it's powerful enough and quiet enough. The volume knob is one of the best feeling knobs on an amp I have heard and it's well built. These sell for about $110.00 new but used ones pop up all the time on Amazon for much less.
