This charger has a story. I bought this **three days** before my daughter was born and  I knew that I did not want to worry about having enough power or finding a wall plug at the hospital so instead of keeping my phone charged I kept this charger topped up instead and used it to charge my phone. This was probably the best purchase I made in 2019. It's almost 2 years later and it's still going strong.
