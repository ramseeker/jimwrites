  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3iJ6HDu">  <img src="/assets/tapemeasure.jpg"></a><p>Sometimes you can cheap out and just buy whatever from the dollar store but I find that it&rsquo;s worth the while to spend the money on good tools as they save so much time and frustration than some crappy thing. An example is I bought a cheap tape measure and it <strong>broke on the very first use</strong>! I had to throw it out and just cough up the money for the brand name one. With tools, you get what you pay for.</p>
