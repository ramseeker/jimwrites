title: LK Phone Screen Protectors

I found this brand of screen protectors for my [Google Pixel 3A](https://amzn.to/3fX4ySE) and I like them. You get three of them, so you have a couple of chances to get it right and straight which is a problem when you try to install these things.

They are glass and don't seem to harm the display or what you see and seem to be optically clear. I also like that these offer a nicer feel to the glass than whatever the stock glass is on phones as it feels smoother to me and makes it easier to scroll with your thumb. Then there's the fact that these might just save your expensive phone screen and it's hard not to suggest these.
